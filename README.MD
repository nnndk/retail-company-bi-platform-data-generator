# Retail Company BI Platform Data Generator

This project provides an opportunity to create test data in .xlsx format (Excel-files). 

To create an Excel file, run src/main.py. There is a function that creates an example-file. 
You can copy its structure and set your own test data.

Below you can find an example of generated data. This is a screenshot from the file generated_files/sales_data.xlsx
